# Ferris
A console crustacean that says what you want it to say
From cloned repo :\n
cargo build
In target folder, pick up the .exe file and place it wherever you want
Add a path variable to the folder containing ferris.exe
Test it in the console ! ferris.exe hello world
You can remove the ".exe" part to just call it by its name
